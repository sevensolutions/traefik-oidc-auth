## 🧪 Local Development and Testing

This project uses a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) for easy access to commonly used tasks. You need to install the Taskfile CLI by following the [official documentation](https://taskfile.dev/installation/). You also need Docker installed on your machine.

You can then run the following command to list all available tasks:

```
task --list
```

The easiest way to get started is to run the plugin with Keycloak because this repo comes with a pre-configured instance.
Just do:

1. Run `task run:keycloak` and wait a moment for everything to be settled
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9080`
3. You will be redirected to Keycloak's login page. Log in with user `admin` and password `admin`.


If you want to start the plugin with your own identity provider, create the following `.env` file in `workspaces/external-idp`:

```
PROVIDER_URL=...
CLIENT_ID=...
CLIENT_SECRET=...
VALIDATE_AUDIENCE=true
```

And then do:
1. Run `task run:external`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9080`
3. You will be redirected to your own identity provider

If you want to play around with the plugin config, modify the file `workspaces/configs/http.yml`.
Changes will be reloaded automatically and you should see some debug output in the container logs.
